        <h2>Information:</h2>

        <p><b>Jharna Whitehurst</b> is a transfer student at North A&T State University. She broke into tech in 2021 after being 1 of 36 participants accepted into a coding bootcamp. Upon graduating from the bootcamp she became an Associate Software Engineer at Ally Bank. Unfortunately at the end of 2023 she was laid off due to the company downsizing. This motivated her to go back to school to complete her undergraduate degree in Information Technology! </p>

        <p><b>Austin Blackmon</b> is a Software Engineer at Ally and also a NC A&T alum. He was my mentor at Ally and he heavily influenced my decision to transfer into NCA&T. He was one of the people who wrote my letter of recommendation.</p>
